Several methods for long-form overlapped multi-speaker audio processing are typically two-staged: i) segment-level processing and ii) inter-segment speaker matching. Speaker embeddings are often used for the latter purpose. Typical speaker embedding extraction approaches only use single-speaker intervals to avoid corrupting the embeddings with speech from interference speakers. However, this often makes speaker embeddings impossible to extract because sufficiently long non-overlapping intervals are not always available. In this paper, we propose using speaker activities as clues to extract the embedding of the speaker-of-interest directly from overlapping speech. Specifically, we concatenate the activity of target and non-target speakers to acoustic features before being fed to the model. We also condition the attention weights used for pooling so that the attention weights of the intervals in which the target speaker is inactive are zero. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in speaker verification and speaker diarization.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2025guided</span><span class="p">,</span>

The EEND-VC-based system estimates the number of speakers by clustering speaker embeddings from small chunks. However, conventional speaker counting struggles in short sessions with limited available embeddings. We address this issue by leveraging the most possible embeddings from multi-channel signals to increase the number of embeddings. One challenge in using embeddings across channels is the biases caused by channel differences. To mitigate this issue, we extend the EEND-VC pipeline with two modifications: (1) applying speech enhancement before extracting speaker embedding to capture the speaker characteristics even from short chunks and (2) grouping microphones based on inter-channel correlation to perform speaker counting within each group and then aggregating these channel-wise results. The proposed scheme was integrated into our CHiME-8 diarization pipeline, achieving superior speaker counting accuracy compared to the CHiME-8 baseline, with 54.2% and 61.4% improvements in the development and evaluation sets, respectively.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">tawara2025multi</span><span class="p">,</span>

In this paper, we propose to assess the potential of Mamba for diarization by comparing the state-of-the-art neural segmentation of the pyannote pipeline with our proposed Mamba-based variant. Mamba’s stronger processing capabilities allow usage of longer local windows, which significantly improve diarization quality by making the speaker embedding extraction more reliable. We find Mamba to be a superior alternative to both traditional RNN and the tested attention-based model.

Multi-talker RNNT (MT-RNNT) aims to achieve recognition without relying on costly front-end source separation. MT-RNNT is conventionally implemented using architectures with multiple encoders or decoders, or by serializing all speakers’ transcriptions into a single output stream. The first approach is computationally expensive, particularly due to the need for multiple encoder processing. In contrast, the second approach involves a complex label generation process, requiring accurate timestamps of all words spoken by all speakers in the mixture, obtained from an external ASR system. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free training scheme for the MT-RNNT (MT-RNNT-AFT) that adopts the standard RNNT architecture. The target labels are created by appending a prompt token corresponding to each speaker at the beginning of the transcription, reflecting the order of each speaker’s appearance in the mixtures. Thus, MT-RNNT-AFT can be trained without relying on accurate alignments, and it can recognize all speakers’ speech with just one round of encoder processing. Experiments show that MT-RNNT-AFT achieves performance comparable to that of the state-of-the-art alternatives, while greatly simplifying the training process.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">moriya2025alignment</span><span class="p">,</span>

We perform diarization first, followed by speech enhancement, and then ASR as the challenge baseline. However, we introduced several key refinements. First, we derived a powerful speaker diarization relying on end-to-end speaker diarization with vector clustering (EEND-VC), multi-channel speaker counting using enhanced embeddings from EEND-VC, and target-speaker voice activity detection (TS-VAD). For speech enhancement, we introduced a novel microphone selection rule to better select the most relevant microphones among the distributed microphones and investigated improvements to beamforming. Finally, for ASR, we developed several models exploiting Whisper and WavLM speech foundation models. We present the results we submitted to the challenge and updated results we obtained afterward.

While most studies have focused on the training schemes or system architectures for each specific task, the auxiliary network for embedding target speaker cues has not been investigated comprehensively in a unified cross-task evaluation. Therefore, this paper attempts to address a fundamental question: what is the preferred speaker embedding for TS tasks? To this end, for the TS-ASR, TSE, and p-VAD tasks, we compare pre-trained speaker encoders (i.e., self-supervised or speaker recognition models) that compute speaker embeddings from pre-recorded enrollment speech of the target speaker with ideal speaker embeddings derived directly from target speaker identity in the form of a one-hot vector. To further understand the property of ideal speaker embedding, we optimize it using a gradient-based approach to improve performance on the TS task. Our analysis unveils that 1) speaker verification performance is somewhat unrelated to TS task performances, 2) the one-hot vector outperforms enrollment-based ones, and 3) the optimal embedding depends on the input mixture.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">ashihara2024investigation</span><span class="p">,</span>

Speaker embeddings are crucial not only for speaker recognition but also for various multi-speaker speech applications such as speaker diarization and target-speaker speech processing. Despite the challenges of obtaining a single speaker’s speech without pre-registration in multi-speaker scenarios, most studies on speaker embedding extraction focus on extracting embeddings only from single-speaker recordings. Some methods have been proposed for extracting speaker embeddings directly from multi-speaker recordings, but they typically require preparing a model for each possible number of speakers or involve complicated training procedures. The proposed method computes the embeddings of multiple speakers by focusing on different parts of the frame-wise embeddings extracted from the input multi-speaker audio. This is achieved by recursively computing attention weights for pooling the frame-wise embeddings. Additionally, we propose using the calculated attention weights to estimate the number of speakers in the recording, which allows the same model to be applied to various numbers of speakers. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in speaker verification and diarization tasks.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2024recursive</span><span class="p">,</span>

To solve this problem, we introduce factor-conditioned captioning (FCC), which first outputs a phrase representing speaking-style factors (e.g., gender, pitch, etc.), and then generates a caption to ensure the model explicitly learns speaking-style factors. We also propose greedy-then-sampling (GtS) decoding, which first predicts speaking-style factors deterministically to guarantee semantic accuracy, and then generates a caption based on factor-conditioned sampling to ensure diversity. Experiments show that FCC outperforms the original caption-based training, and with GtS, it generates more diverse captions while keeping style prediction performance.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">ando2024factor</span><span class="p">,</span>

Implementing real-time TSE is challenging as the computational complexity must be reduced to provide real-time operation. This work introduces to Conv-TasNet-based TSE a new architecture based on state space modeling (SSM) that has been shown to model long-term dependency effectively. Owing to SSM, fewer dilated convolutional layers are required to capture temporal dependency in Conv-TasNet, resulting in the reduction of model complexity. We also enlarge the window length and shift of the convolutional (TasNet) frontend encoder to reduce the computational cost further; the performance decline is compensated by over-parameterization of the frontend encoder. The proposed method reduces the real-time factor by 78% from the conventional causal Conv-TasNet-based TSE while matching its performance.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">sato2024speakerbeamss</span><span class="p">,</span>

Although many streaming active learning methods have been proposed for classification, few efforts have been made for regression problems, which are often handled in the industrial field. In this paper, we propose to use the regression-via-classification framework for streaming active learning for regression. Regression-via-classification transforms regression problems into classification problems so that streaming active learning methods proposed for classification problems can be applied directly to regression problems. Experimental validation on four real data sets shows that the proposed method can perform regression with higher accuracy at the same annotation cost.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2024streaming</span><span class="p">,</span>

End-to-end neural diarization (EEND) has achieved overlap-aware speaker diarization by formulating it as a multi-label classification problem. It has also been extended for a flexible number of speakers by introducing speaker-wise attractors. However, the output number of speakers of attractor-based EEND is empirically capped; it cannot deal with cases where the number of speakers appearing during inference is higher than that during training because its speaker counting is trained in a fully supervised manner. Our method, EEND-GLA, solves this problem by introducing unsupervised clustering into attractor-based EEND. In the method, the input audio is first divided into short blocks, then attractor-based diarization is performed for each block, and finally the results of each blocks are clustered on the basis of the similarity between locally-calculated attractors. While the number of output speakers is limited within each block, the total number of speakers estimated for the entire input can be higher than the limitation. To use EEND-GLA in an online manner, our method also extends the speaker-tracing buffer, which was originally proposed to enable online inference of conventional EEND. We introduce a block-wise buffer update to make the speaker-tracing buffer compatible with EEND-GLA. Finally, to improve online diarization, our method improves the buffer update method and revisits the variable chunk-size training of EEND. The experimental results demonstrate that EEND-GLA can perform speaker diarization of an unseen number of speakers in both offline and online inferences.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2023online</span><span class="p">,</span>

Text data for synthetic speech is mostly obtained from in-domain text or generated text using augmentation. However, obtaining large amounts of in-domain text data with diverse lexical contexts is difficult, especially in low-resource scenarios. This paper proposes using text from a large generic-domain source and applying a domain filtering method to choose the relevant text data. This method involves two filtering steps: 1) selecting text based on its semantic similarity to the available in-domain text and 2) diversifying the vocabulary of the selected text using a greedy-search algorithm. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the conventional text augmentation approach, with the relative reduction of word-error-rate ranging from 6% to 25% on the LibriSpeech dataset and 15% on a low-resource Vietnamese dataset.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">ho2023synthetic</span><span class="p">,</span>

This paper investigates whether the improvement in anti-spoofing with pretrained models holds under the condition that the models are available to attackers. As the attacker, we train a model that enhances spoofed utterances so that the speaker embedding extractor based on the pretrained models cannot distinguish between bona fide and spoofed utterances. Experimental results show that the gains the anti-spoofing models obtained by using the pretrained models almost disappear if the attacker also makes use of the pretrained models.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">ito2023spoofing</span><span class="p">,</span>

In contrast to the conventional cascaded approach to speaker diarization, EEND methods are better in terms of speaker overlap handling. However, EEND still has a disadvantage in that it cannot deal with a flexible number of speakers. To remedy this problem, we introduce encoder-decoder-based attractor calculation module (EDA) to EEND. Once frame-wise embeddings are obtained, EDA sequentially generates speaker-wise attractors on the basis of a sequence-to-sequence method using an LSTM encoder-decoder. The attractor generation continues until a stopping condition is satisfied; thus, the number of attractors can be flexible. Diarization results are then estimated as dot products of the attractors and embeddings. The embeddings from speaker overlaps result in larger dot product values with multiple attractors; thus, this method can deal with speaker overlaps. Because the maximum number of output speakers is still limited by the training set, we also propose an iterative inference method to remove this restriction. Further, we propose a method that aligns the estimated diarization results with the results of an external speech activity detector, which enables fair comparison against cascaded approaches. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real datasets show that EEND-EDA outperforms the conventional cascaded approach.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2022encoderdecoder</span><span class="p">,</span>

To solve this problem, we first investigate which parts of end-to-end ASR models contribute to high accuracy in the target domain while preventing catastrophic forgetting. We conduct experiments on incremental domain adaptation from the LibriSpeech dataset to the AMI meeting corpus with two popular end-to-end ASR models and found that adapting only the linear layers of their encoders can prevent catastrophic forgetting. Then, on the basis of this finding, we develop an element-wise parameter selection focused on specific layers to further reduce the number of fine-tuning parameters. Experimental results show that our approach consistently prevents catastrophic forgetting compared to parameter selection from the whole model.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">takashima2022updating</span><span class="p">,</span>

We revisit the original Fano’s inequality and argue that the studies did not take into account the information lost when multiple model predictions are combined into a final prediction. To address this issue, we generalize the previous theory to incorporate the information loss. Further, we empirically validate and demonstrate the proposed theory through extensive experiments on actual systems. The theory reveals the strengths and weaknesses of systems on each metric, which will push the theoretical understanding of ensemble learning and give us insights into designing systems.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">morishita2022rethinking</span><span class="p">,</span>

Simulated datasets play an essential role in the training of EEND, but as yet there has been insufficient investigation into an optimal simulation method. We thus propose a method to simulate natural conversational speech. In contrast to conventional methods, which simply combine the speech of multiple speakers, our method takes turn-taking into account. We define four types of speaker transition and sequentially arrange them to simulate natural conversations. The dataset simulated using our method was found to be statistically similar to the real dataset in terms of the silence and overlap ratios.

However, the main drawback is that it cannot deal with the case where the number of speakers is larger than the one observed during training. This is because its speaker counting relies on supervised learning. In this work, we introduce an unsupervised clustering process embedded in the attractor-based end-to-end diarization. We first split a sequence of frame-wise embeddings into short subsequences and then perform attractor-based diarization for each subsequence. Given subsequence-wise diarization results, inter-subsequence speaker correspondence is obtained by unsupervised clustering of the vectors computed from the attractors from all the subsequences. This makes it possible to produce diarization results of a large number of speakers for the whole recording even if the number of output speakers for each subsequence is limited. Experimental results showed that our method could produce accurate diarization results of an unseen number of speakers. Our method achieved 11.84 %, 28.33 %, and 19.49 % on the CALLHOME, DIHARD II, and DIHARD III datasets, respectively, each of which is better than the conventional end-to-end diarization methods.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2021towards</span><span class="p">,</span>

In this paper, we propose an extended STB for flexible numbers of speakers, FLEX-STB.

In this paper, we explore a pseudo-labeling approach that employs unlabeled data. First, we propose an iterative pseudo-label method for EEND, which trains the model using unlabeled data of a target condition. Then, we also propose a committee-based training method to improve the performance of EEND. To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct the experiments of model adaptation using labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results on the CALLHOME dataset show that our proposed pseudo-label achieved a 37.4% relative diarization error rate reduction compared to a seed model.

Clustering-based diarization methods partition frames into clusters of the number of speakers; thus, they typically cannot handle overlapping speech because each frame is assigned to one speaker. On the other hand, some end-to-end diarization methods can handle overlapping speech by treating the problem as multi-label classification. Although some methods can treat a flexible number of speakers, they do not perform well when the number of speakers is large. To compensate for each other’s weakness, we propose to use a two-speaker end-to-end diarization method as post-processing of the results obtained by a clustering-based method. We iteratively select two speakers from the results and update the results of the two speakers to improve the overlapped region.

These buffered frames are stacked with the input frames in the current chunk and fed into a self-attention network. Our method ensures consistent diarization outputs across the buffer and the current chunk by checking the correlation between their corresponding outputs. Additionally, we trained SA-EEND with variable chunk-sizes to mitigate the mismatch between training and inference introduced by the speaker-tracing buffer mechanism.

GSS is a speech separation method that uses diarization information to update parameters of the generative model of observation signals. Previous studies have shown that GSS performs well in multi-talker scenarios. However, it requires a large amount of calculation time, which is an obstacle to the deployment of online applications. It is also a problem that the offline GSS is an utterance-wise algorithm so that it produces latency according to the length of the utterance. With the proposed algorithm, block-wise input samples and corresponding time annotations are concatenated with those in the preceding context and used to update the parameters. Using the context enables the algorithm to estimate time-frequency masks accurately only from one iteration of optimization for each block, and its latency does not depend on the utterance length but predetermined block length. It also reduces calculation cost by updating only the parameters of active speakers in each block and its context. Evaluation on the CHiME-6 corpus and a meeting corpus showed that the proposed algorithm achieved almost the same performance as the conventional offline GSS algorithm but with 32x faster calculation, which is sufficient for real-time applications.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2021blockonline</span><span class="p">,</span>

Evaluation on our real meeting datasets showed that our framework achieved a character error rate (CER) of 28.7% by using 11 distributed microphones, while a monaural microphone placed on the center of the table had a CER of 38.2%.

Recently proposed end-to-end speaker diarization outperformed conventional clustering-based speaker diarization, but it has one drawback: it is less flexible in terms of the number of speakers. This paper proposes a method for encoder-decoder based attractor calculation (EDA), which first generates a flexible number of attractors from a speech embedding sequence. Then, the generated multiple attractors are multiplied by the speech embedding sequence to produce the same number of speaker activities. The speech embedding sequence is extracted using the conventional self-attentive end-to-end neural speaker diarization (SA-EEND) network. In a two-speaker condition, our method achieved a 2.69% diarization error rate (DER) on simulated mixtures and a 8.07% DER on the two-speaker subset of CALLHOME, while vanilla SA-EEND attained 4.56% and 9.54%, respectively. In unknown numbers of speakers conditions, our method attained a 15.29% DER on CALLHOME, while the x-vector-based clustering method achieved a 19.43% DER.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2020endtoend</span><span class="p">,</span>

In contrast to passive service, e.g., providing service only after being spoken to, proactive service initiates an interaction at an early stage, e.g., talking to potential visitors who need the robot’s help in advance. This paper addresses how to anticipate the start of user interaction. We propose an approach using only a single RGB camera that anticipates whether a visitor will come to the robot for interaction or just pass it by. In the proposed approach, we (i) utilize the visitor’s pose information from captured images incorporating facial information, (ii) train a CNN-LSTM–based model in an end-to-end manner with an exponential loss for early anticipation, and (iii) during the training, the network branch for facial keypoints acquired as the part of the human pose information is taught to mimic the branch trained with the face image from a specialized face detector with a human verification. By virtue of (iii), at the inference, we can run our model in an embedded system processing only the pose information without an additional face detector and typical accuracy drop.We evaluated the proposed approach on our collected real world data with a real service robot and publicly available JPL interaction dataset and found that it achieved accurate anticipation performance.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">ito2020anticipating</span><span class="p">,</span>

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective Modality Ensemble that incorporates visual and textual deep-learning models, which are independently trained, rather than providing a single multi-modal joint network. To this end, we first fine-tune four pre-trained visual models (i.e., Inception-ResNet, PolyNet, SENet, and PNASNet) and four textual models (i.e., BERT, GPT-2, Transformer-XL, and XLNet). Then, we fuse their predictions with ensemble methods to effectively capture cross-modal correlations.

Speech material is the same as the previous CHiME-5 recordings except for accurate array synchronization. The material was elicited using a dinner party scenario with efforts taken to capture data that is representative of natural conversational speech. This paper provides a baseline description of the CHiME-6 challenge for both segmented multispeaker speech recognition (Track 1) and unsegmented multispeaker speech recognition (Track 2).

In the proposed method, each speaker’s speech activity is regarded as a single random variable, and is estimated sequentially conditioned on previously estimated other speakers’ speech activities. Similar to other sequence-to-sequence models, the proposed method produces a variable number of speakers with a stop sequence condition. We evaluated the proposed method on multi-speaker audio recordings of a variable number of speakers.

However, the clustering-based approach has a number of problems; i.e., (i) it is not optimized to minimize diarization errors directly, (ii) it cannot handle speaker overlaps correctly, and (iii) it has trouble adapting their speaker embedding models to real audio recordings with speaker overlaps. To solve these problems, we propose the End-to-End Neural Diarization (EEND), in which a neural network directly outputs speaker diarization results given a multi-speaker recording. To realize such an end-to-end model, we formulate the speaker diarization problem as a multi-label classification problem and introduce a permutation-free objective function to directly minimize diarization errors. Besides its end-to-end simplicity, the EEND method can explicitly handle speaker overlaps during training and inference. Just by feeding multi-speaker recordings with corresponding speaker segment labels, our model can be easily adapted to real conversations. We evaluated our method on simulated speech mixtures and real conversation datasets. The results showed that the EEND method outperformed the state-of-the-art x-vector clustering-based method, while it correctly handled speaker overlaps. We explored the neural network architecture for the EEND method, and found that the self-attention-based neural network was the key to achieving excellent performance. In contrast to conditioning the network only on its previous and next hidden states, as is done using bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM), self-attention is directly conditioned on all the frames. By visualizing the attention weights, we show that self-attention captures global speaker characteristics in addition to local speech activity dynamics, making it especially suitable for dealing with the speaker diarization problem.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@misc</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">fujita2020endtoend</span><span class="p">,</span>

TS-ASR is a technique to automatically extract and recognize only the speech of a target speaker given a short sample utterance of that speaker. One obvious drawback of TS-ASR is that it cannot be used when the speakers in the recordings are unknown because it requires a sample of the target speakers in advance of decoding. To remove this limitation, we propose an iterative method, in which (i) the estimation of speaker embeddings and (ii) TS-ASR based on the estimated speaker embeddings are alternately executed. We evaluated the proposed method by using very challenging dialogue recordings in which the speaker overlap ratio was over 20%. We confirmed that the proposed method significantly reduced both the word error rate (WER) and diarization error rate (DER). Our proposed method combined with i-vector speaker embeddings ultimately achieved a WER that differed by only 2.1 % from that of TS-ASR given oracle speaker embeddings. Furthermore, our method can solve speaker diarization simultaneously as a by-product and achieved better DER than that of the conventional clustering-based speaker diarization method based on i-vector.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">kanda2019simultaneous</span><span class="p">,</span>

To solve these problems, the End-to-End Neural Diarization (EEND), in which a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) network directly outputs speaker diarization results given a multi-talker recording, was recently proposed. In this study, we enhance EEND by introducing self-attention blocks instead of BLSTM blocks. In contrast to BLSTM, which is conditioned only on its previous and next hidden states, self-attention is directly conditioned on all the other frames, making it much suitable for dealing with the speaker diarization problem. We evaluated our proposed method on simulated mixtures, real telephone calls, and real dialogue recordings. The experimental results revealed that the self-attention was the key to achieving good performance and that our proposed method performed significantly better than the conventional BLSTM-based method. Our method was even better than that of the state-of-the-art x-vector clustering-based method. Finally, by visualizing the latent representation, we show that the self-attention can capture global speaker characteristics in addition to local speech activity dynamics.

Some studies have tackled this problem; however, they narrow their applicability by impractical assumptions or use of scenario-specific features. Some attempts have been made to widen the applicability by avoiding the use of text modality, which is said to be highly domain dependent, but it decreases the detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal response obligation detector, which uses visual, audio, and text information for highly-accurate detection, with its unsupervised online domain adaptation to solve the domain dependency problem. Our domain adaptation consists of the weights adaptation of the logistic regression for every modality and an embedding assignment for new words to cope with the high domain dependency of text modality. Experimental results on the dataset collected at a station and commercial building showed that our method achieved high response obligation detection accuracy and was able to handle domain change automatically.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2019multimodal</span><span class="p">,</span>

As an example of a dinner party scenario, we have chosen the data presented during the CHiME-5 speech recognition challenge, where the baseline ASR had a 73.3% word error rate (WER), and even the best performing system at the CHiME-5 challenge had a 46.1% WER. We extensively investigated a combination of the guided source separation-based speech enhancement technique and an already proposed strong ASR backend and found that a tight combination of these techniques provided substantial accuracy improvements. Our final system achieved WERs of 39.94% and 41.64% for the development and evaluation data, respectively, both of which are the best published results for the dataset.

However, due to the lack of omnidirectional images to train CNNs, few CNN-based detectors have been proposed for omnidirectional pedestrian detection. One significant difference between omnidirectional images and perspective images is that the appearance of pedestrians is rotated in omnidirectional images. A previous method has dealt with this by transforming omnidirectional images into perspective images in the test phase. However, this method has significant drawbacks, namely, the computational cost and the performance degradation caused by the transformation. To address this issue, we propose a rotation invariant training method, which only uses randomly rotated perspective images without any additional annotation. By this method, existing large-scale datasets can be utilized. In test phase, omnidirectional images can be used without the transformation. To group predicted bounding boxes, we also develop a bounding box refinement, which works better for our detector than non-maximum suppression. The proposed detector achieved a state-of-the-art performance on four public benchmarks.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">tamura2019omnidirectional</span><span class="p">,</span>

However, in real-world conditions, there are cases in which the number of samples in each class continues to increase and samples from novel classes appear. In particular, dynamic datasets in which each individual user creates samples and continues the updating process often has content that varies considerably between different users, and the number of samples per person is very limited. A single classifier common to all users cannot handle such dynamic data. Bridging the gap between the laboratory environment and the real world has not yet been accomplished on a large scale. Personalizing a classifier incrementally for each user is a promising way to do this. In this paper, we address the personalization problem, which involves adapting to the user’s domain incrementally using a very limited number of samples. We propose a simple yet effective personalization framework, which is a combination of the nearest class mean classifier and the 1-nearest neighbor classifier based on deep features. To conduct realistic experiments, we made use of a new dataset of daily food images collected by a food-logging application. Experimental results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2018personalized</span><span class="p">,</span>

Many researches in cognitive science have confirmed human ability in the face-voice matching tasks. Such ability is useful for creating natural human machine interaction systems and in many other applications. In this paper, we propose a face-voice matching model that learns cross-modal embeddings between face images and voice characteristics. We constructed a novel FVCeleb dataset which consists of face images and utterances from 1,078 persons. These persons were selected from the MS-Celeb-1M face image dataset and the VoxCeleb audio dataset. In two-alternative forced-choice matching task with an audio input and two face-image candidates of the same gender, our model achieved 62.2% and 56.5% accuracy on the FVCeleb and the subset of the GRID corpus, respectively. These results are very similar to human performance reported in cognitive science studies.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2018facevoice</span><span class="p">,</span>

One important challenge in this field involves assisting users in recording their daily food intake. In recent years, food image recognition has attracted a considerable amount of research interest as a new technology to help record users ’food intake. However, since there are so many types of food, and it is unrealistic to expect a system to recognize all foods. In this paper, we propose an optimal combination of image recognition and interactive search in order to record users ’intake of food. The image recognition generates a list of candidate names for a given food picture. The user chooses the closest name to the meal, which triggers an associative food search based on food contents, such as ingredients. We show the proposed system is efficient to assist users maintain food journals.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">amano2016food</span><span class="p">,</span>

We explain this characteristic using Gibrat’s law, and construct a model for the region-size distribution of objects in images. We applied the model to the filtering of object proposals generated by selective search and edge boxes. We obtained a significant reduction of 40.6% in the number of hypotheses compared with a conventional selective search, despite a decrease of only 0.007 in the Mean Average Best Overlap.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">horiguchi2016lognormal</span><span class="p">,</span>
