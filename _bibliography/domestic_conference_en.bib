    abstract={This paper proposes a guided speaker embedding extraction system, which extracts speaker embeddings of the target speaker using speech activities of target and interference speakers as clues. Several methods for long-form overlapped multi-speaker audio processing are typically two-staged: i) segment-level processing and ii) inter-segment speaker matching. Speaker embeddings are often used for the latter purpose. Typical speaker embedding extraction approaches only use single-speaker intervals to avoid corrupting the embeddings with speech from interference speakers. However, this often makes speaker embeddings impossible to extract because sufficiently long non-overlapping intervals are not always available. In this paper, we propose using speaker activities as clues to extract the embedding of the speaker-of-interest directly from overlapping speech. Specifically, we concatenate the activity of target and non-target speakers to acoustic features before being fed to the model. We also condition the attention weights used for pooling so that the attention weights of the intervals in which the target speaker is inactive are zero. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in speaker verification and diarization.},

    abstract={This work presents a novel speaking-style captioning method that generates diverse descriptions while accurately including speaking-style information such as gender, pitch, and volume. Conventional methods rely on original captions, which contain not only speaking-style-related terms but also syntactic words, making it difficult to learn speaking-style characteristics from speech and often resulting in incorrect captions. To address this problem, the proposed method introduces factor-conditioned captioning (FCC), which first outputs a factor phrase representing speaking-style information and then generates a caption to ensure the model explicitly learns speaking-style factors. Additionally, we propose greedy-then-sampling (GtS) decoding, which first predicts speaking-style factors deterministically to guarantee semantic accuracy and then generates a caption based on factor-conditioned sampling to ensure diversity. Experiments show that the proposed method generates more diverse captions while improving style prediction performance compared to conventional methods.},
